                My journey into tech began during the COVID-19 lockdown when the digital world became our lifeline.
                As an avid consumer of technology, I was fascinated by how everything from work to social interaction—shifted
                online. This sparked a curiosity in me, and I decided to transition from being just a user to a
                creator in this digital realm.
                <br /> <br />

                Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of developing software for an
                <a href="https://wokober.com/" target="_blank" className='about-link'> Educational Foundation</a> in Northern Uganda,
                a <a href="https://prestigedrivingschool.co.ug/" target="_blank" className='about-link'>Leading driving school</a> in Uganda,
                a <a href="https://www.femispace.com/" target="_blank" className='about-link'>Female health and wellness company</a> in the USA, and
                a <a href="#" target="_blank" className='about-link'>Medical laboratory</a>.
                These experiences have broadened my understanding of how technology can be integrated into
                various facets of life, driving meaningful impact in each area.
                <br /> <br />

                My goal is to continue learning and improving myself and to continuously contribute to the digital world, through crafting applications that not only perform
                well but also enhance the user experience. I’m even starting a blog to share insights from my self improvement journey.

                <br /> <br />

                And when I’m not at the computer, I’m usually out running, watching soccer, reading, and eagerly awaiting
                the next episode of <a href="#" target="_blank" className='about-link'>One Piece</a>.
